# Basic ML in Rust

I'm currently taking the excellent [Coursera deep learning course by Andrew
Ng](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning), and since I'm
a fan of the Rust programming language, I thought it would be a fun and useful
exercise to recreate some of the project lessons (originally all in Python)
in Rust. I plan on writing a blog entry about the result of this project once
it's done.

```
cargo build
cargo test
cargo run
```
